# NaughtyWords for Bukkit
### The simple censorship plugin

This is a simple chat reader which checks each chat message sent by a user for strings that you have declared as Naughty. If the message _should_ contain a naughty word (gasp!), they will be kicked and ridiculed. Upon the fifth naughty word, they will be permabanned and shunned ferociously.

### Installation

Just put the jar in the plugins folder and name your naughty words in the "naughtywords.txt" file, as separated by newlines. It'll take care of the rest. :)

### Known Issues

This is a simple message checker. If you were to, say, put the word "retard" under the naughty words list, "fire retardant" would trigger a kick. I'll add a "do not kick for" in a future version.
